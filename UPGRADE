Upgrade from 1.0 to 1.1
=======================

This document describes the changes made in symfony 1.1 and what need
to be done to upgrade your symfony 1.0 projects.

How to upgrade?
---------------

To upgrade a project, you first need to upgrade symfony via PEAR or
change your `config/config.php` to update the symfony directory.

Then, you can launch the following task from your project directory to
perform an automatic upgrade:

  ./symfony project:upgrade1.1

This task can be launched several times without any side effect. Each time
you upgrade to a new symfony 1.1 beta / RC or the final symfony 1.1, you
need to launch this task.

The remaining sections explains backward incompatible changes.

Flash attributes
----------------

Flash attributes are now managed directly by `sfUser`. New usage:

  [php]
  // action
  $this->getUser()->setFlash('notice', 'foo');
  $notice = $this->getUser()->getFlash('notice');

  // template
  <?php $sf_user->hasFlash('notice'): ?>
    <?php echo $sf_user->getFlash('notice') ?>
  <?php endif; ?>

The flash entry in `filters.yml` must be removed too as the `sfFlashFilter`
was removed.

The `project:upgrade1.1` task makes all those changes for you.

Deprecated methods in sfComponent
---------------------------------

The following methods of `sfComponent` have been removed:

  * `->getPresentationFor()`
  * `->sendEmail()`

They are accessible from `sfController`:

  [php]
  // action
  $this->getController()->getPresentationFor(...);

The `project:upgrade1.1` task makes all those changes for you.
