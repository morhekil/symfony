  err0001: |
    Symfony enforces some `php.ini` values threw the `php.yml` configuration file (under `check` category).

    It seems you have a key in your `php.ini` configuration file with a "un-authorized" value (according to the symfony `php.yml` configuration file).

    How can you fix this problem?

    * change the value in `php.ini`

    * change the `php.yml` file (you must copy the original file referenced in the error message to `yourpoject/config/php.yml` to override it)

    * add `php_value magic_quotes_gpc 0` to the .htaccess of your project

    Here is a sample `php.yml` file:

      set:
        magic_quotes_runtime: off
        log_errors:           on
        arg_separator.output: \&amp;

      check:
        magic_quotes_gpc:     off
        register_globals:     off

  err0002: |
    You want to check a `php.ini` value but the key you specified doesn't exist in `php.ini`.
