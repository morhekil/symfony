Symfony at a glance
===================

Overview
--------

Symfony is a PHP5 framework, object-oriented and based on the MVC model. It allows to separate easily the business rules, the server logic and the presentation of a web application. It also contains numerous tools and classes aimed at shortening the time of a complex web application development.

Introduction
------------

Symfony is a complete framework designed to help and speedup the development of web applications.

It is based on the following concepts :

*   compatible with as many environments as possible
*   easy to install and configure
*   simple to learn
*   enterprise ready
*   convention rather than configuration, supporting fallback calls
*   simple in most cases, but still flexible enough to adapt to complex cases
*   most common web features included
*   compliant with most of the web "bests pratices" and with web "design patterns"
*   very readable code with easy maintenance
*   open source

The main concept underlying the Symfony framework is that the most common tasks have to be done automatically so that the developper can focus entirely on the specificities of an application. There is no need to reinvent the wheel every time a new web application is built.

To fulfill these requirements, Symfony was written entirely in [PHP5](http://www.php.net/manual/en/migration5.php). It has been thoroughly tried on various real world projects, and is actually in use for high demand e-business websites. It is compatible with most of the available databases, among which :

*   MySQL
*   PostgreSQL
*   Oracle
*   MSSQL
*   and any other database if a [Creole](http://creole.phpdb.org/wiki/) driver exists for it

The Symfony object model relies on three distinct layers:

*   a database abstraction
*   an objet-relational mapping 
*   a Model-View-Controller model for the front and back-office 

Common features of web projects are made easy since Symfony natively automates them:

*   internationalization
*   templating with helpers
*   form validation
*   cache management
*   shopping cart management
*   smart URLs
*   scaffolding
*   email sending
*   list paging
*   Ajax communication

In addition, to fulfill the requirements of enterprises having their own coding guidelines and project management rules, Symfony can be entirely reconfigured through [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) configuration files. It provides by default several development environments and is bundled with tools to easily achieve the following operations:

*   prototyping
*   content management
*   live configuration changes
*   deployment
*   unit testing
*   applicative testing
*   logging
*   debugging

Symfony uses some code fragments of other open source projects:

*   [Creole](http://creole.phpdb.org/wiki/), for the database abstraction layer 
*   [Propel](http://propel.phpdb.org/trac/), for the object-relational mapping layer
*   [Mojavi](http://www.mojavi.org/), for the Model-View-Controller model layer
